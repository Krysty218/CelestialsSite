But with Hugo, it’s blazingly fast—once you figure out how everything clicks together. What started as a simple setup turned into a deep dive into theme customization, structuring content, and deploying without breaking things. Here’s how we forged The Celestials\u0026rsquo; Realm, what burned down, and what we reforged.\nWhy Hugo + Blowfish Lowkey? # We wanted something fast, flexible, and hands-off—Hugo checked all the boxes. Markdown-based content? Perfect. Static speed? Insane. Blowfish Lowkey gave us a solid base, but we had to hammer it into shape to fit our vision.\nWhat We Reforged # The Odyssey (Blog) → A chronicle of our journey, from insights to experiments. Memento (Personal) → Thoughts, reflections, and things worth remembering. Furnace (Projects) → The fires where our projects take shape—the process, struggles, and breakthroughs. Miscellaneous → Anything that doesn’t fit but still deserves a place. The Forge (Showcase) → Where we present our finished creations, tempered and refined. What Burned Down (and How We Rebuilt It) # 1. Hugo’s Learning Curve # Hugo is blazingly fast, but its templating system? Not so intuitive. Wrestling with partials, taxonomies, and front matter took some trial and error.\nFix: Reverse-engineering Blowfish’s structure made it click.\n2. Homepage Author Display Instead of Welcome Text # Blowfish’s default behavior showed author metadata where a welcome message should be.\nFix: Tweaked hero.html inside layouts/partials/home to actually greet visitors properly.\n3. Vercel Deployment Hiccups # First deploy? Crashed. Hugo version mismatch.\nFix: Locked the correct Hugo version in vercel.json and smooth sailing from there.\nLessons From The Fire # Hugo makes static sites blazingly fast, but expect a few bruises learning it. Check the theme’s defaults first—sometimes small tweaks fix big annoyances. Vercel is smooth, but double-check your Hugo version before deploying. What’s Next? # The site is up, but we’re not done. Next, we’re refining the design, enhancing navigation, and maybe adding search functionality. If you’re thinking about using Hugo + Blowfish, go for it—just be ready to break and remake things along the way.\n","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/project/hugo-site-blog/","section":"The Odyssey","summary":"A deep dive into how we built The Celestials\u0026rsquo; website using Hugo and Blowfish Lowkey, the challenges we faced, and the lessons learned along the way.","title":"Crafting the Celestials' Realm","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/project/","section":"The Odyssey","summary":"","title":"Furnace","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/furnace/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Furnace","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/hugo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hugo","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"The Celestials","summary":"","title":"The Celestials","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/","section":"The Odyssey","summary":"","title":"The Odyssey","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/vercel/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Vercel","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/web-development/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Web Development","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"Coming soon\u0026hellip; Stay tuned for exciting projects!\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/showcase/","section":"Celestial Forge","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eComing soon\u0026hellip; Stay tuned for exciting projects!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Celestial Forge","type":"showcase"},{"content":"Please Reach out to us here\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/contact/","section":"Contact","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePlease Reach out to us here\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Contact","type":"contact"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/personal/","section":"The Odyssey","summary":"","title":"Memento","type":"blog"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/misc/","section":"The Odyssey","summary":"","title":"Miscellaneous","type":"blog"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
